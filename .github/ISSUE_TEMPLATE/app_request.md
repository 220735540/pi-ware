Is this app installable with `sudo apt install`?

An app must have 4 core files to be added to pi-ware,
- ``description.txt``
- ``install``
- ``uninstall``
- ``icon.png``

A tutorial on adding an app is availible on our <a href="https://github.com/zachthecoder14/pi-ware/wiki/Add-apps-to-pi-ware.-(Tutorial)">wiki</a>

If you've created a zip file for this app, upload it here.
